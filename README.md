# Simulating-a-MIPS-Processor
This project involves developing the core functionality of a mini processor simulator called MySPIM using C on a Unix platform. MySPIM simulates a MIPS processor, allowing you to explore how the processor executes machine code cycle-by-cycle. The project focuses on implementing a single-cycle datapath for the MIPS processor, handling 14 specific instructions, and simulating memory and register operations. This project required to fill in critical functions in the provided project file, including an ALU function and several datapath-related functions, to complete the simulation.
